Total: 20 minutes  
Prep: 20 minutes  
Yield: 12 Servings  
  
| Measurement | Ingredient |
| :---------: | :--------: |
|   8 Cups    |    Milk    |
|    1 Cup    |    Rice    |
|    1 Cup    |   Sugar    |
|   1/2 tsp   |    Salt    |
|    1 tsp    |  Vanilla   |

Directions:
Place water in bottom half of double boiler and allow to heat while preparing pudding ingredients. In top half of double boiler, place milk, rice, sugar and salt. Place over boiling water and adjust heat so that water simmers.

For first half hour of cooking, stir frequently to stop rice from lumping. Continue to cook about another hour and half until rice is very soft. Stir occasionally. Add vanilla and stir to blend.

Stir until pudding thickens slightly. Serve either warm or cold. Pudding thickens with standing. (This is a recipe I developed myself because I couldn't find one that I liked.) It is important to cook the rice very soft, because after refrigeration, the rice has a tendency to harden
