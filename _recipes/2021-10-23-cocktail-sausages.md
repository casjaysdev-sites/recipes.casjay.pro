| 2 (16oz packages) | Cocktail Sausages |
|       1 Cup       |     BBQ sauce     |
|      3/4 Cup      |    Grape Jelly    |

Directions:

Stir 1 cup of your favorite BBQ sauce (a thick sauce works best) and 3/4 cup grape jelly in your slow cooker until well combined.
Add 2 (16oz) packages of cocktail sausages (I like Litâ€™l Smokies), and stir.
Cover and cook on LOW for 2-3 hours.
