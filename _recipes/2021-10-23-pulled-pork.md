Total: 6 Hours  
Prep: 10 minutes  
Yield: 4 Servings  
  
|     Measurement      | Ingredient |
| :------------------: | :--------: |
|       2 Pounds       | pork butt  |
| 1 Bottle (18 Ounces) | BBQ sauce  |
|        1 Can         | Root Beer  |

Directions:  

Place the pork (about 2 pounds of pork butt or shoulder) in your slow cooker and pour the can of root beer on top.  
Cover and cook on LOW for about 6 hours. You should be able to shred the meat easily with a fork when itâ€™s done. Check your meat after 4-5 hours to see the progress. You may need a little more or less than 6 hours depending on your slow cooker and the cut of meat.  
After your pork is done, drain the root beer and shred the pork with a fork or claws on a large plate or chopping block.  
Place the shredded pork back into your slow cooker and add about 18 ounces of your favorite BBQ sauce and stir to combine. Let warm for about 15 minutes before serving.  
Serve on hamburger buns or sandwich rolls.
